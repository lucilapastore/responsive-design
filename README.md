# Building with Responsive Design [Collaborative Project]
This project consists of replicating the [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/) website putting emphasis on how it behaves differently depending on the size of the screen where the website is rendered.

You can find the original project specification at: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design

# Requirements included:
- Align all elements with float OR flex AND your own Grid as described in previous lesson.
- This page contains 3 breakpoints (we had to figure out the exact width for each breakpoint by ourselfs).
- Double-check if you page layout does not brake on smaller screens.

# Take-Away Skills:
By the end of this project, you knew how to use relative units and media queries to create websites that can be viewed across devices of all sizes.
